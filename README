Introduction
============

This is a irssi plugin for grepping urls from IRC and storing them in
PostgreSQL database.


Installation
============

Put urllogpg.pl to your irssi script directory (most likely it is
~/.irssi/scripts) and edit the dbname, username and password variables
in urllogpg.pl to have appropriate values.

To use this plugin you need to have a PostgreSQL database set up, and
you have to create a table (described in "Expected database tables"
section) before loading the plugin or it will fail.


Expected database tables
========================

This is more or less what your table should look like. Note that the id
column is expected to be auto incremented by some sequence (here
links_id_seq).

               Table "links"
Column  | Type      |         Modifiers
--------+-----------+------------------------------------------
id      | integer   | not null default nextval('links_id_seq'::regclass)
channel | text      | not null
time    | timestamp |
nick    | text      | not null
link    | text      | not null
title   | text      |

An example of the create statement:

CREATE TABLE links (
   id integer DEFAULT nextval('links_id_seq'::regclass) NOT NULL,
   channel text NOT NULL,
   "time" timestamp without time zone,
   nick text NOT NULL,
   link text NOT NULL,
   title text
);

An example of the sequence:

CREATE SEQUENCE links_id_seq
   START WITH 1
   INCREMENT BY 1
   NO MINVALUE
   NO MAXVALUE
   CACHE 1;


Bugs/known issues
===================

The plugin supports automatically fetching also the titles of the links
caught in the chat. It is turned off by default since it is fairly
stupid function and will try to download the content of *ANY* link it
catches, and try to parse for a html title-element inside it. This means
you may end up downloading very large files for parsing, even if they
are binaries. I strongly suggest you keep the feature turned off for
now.
